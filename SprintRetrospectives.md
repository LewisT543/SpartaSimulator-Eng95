# Retrospective

## Sprint 1
- Sprint time: *11/10/21 -12/10/21*
###What Went Well?
We were able to communicate efficiently and effectively as a team and stay aware of the changes and steps we were taking. The result of the team work resulted in a successful program which was also tested.
###What Went Wrong?
 We were confused on exactly where to allocate everyone at the start of the project as there was no code and so not every group member had a task that they could proceed with.
