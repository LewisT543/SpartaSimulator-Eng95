# Retrospective

## Sprint 1
- Sprint time: *11/10/21 -12/10/21*
### What Went Well?

We were able to communicate efficiently and effectively as a team and stay aware of the changes and steps we were taking. The result of the teamwork resulted in a successful program which was thoroughly tested.​

### What Went Wrong?

We were confused on exactly where to allocate everyone at the start of the project as there was no code and so not every group member had a task that they could proceed with.

### How can we improve

In the next sprint or even any project that we do we are going to plan how we will start the project or sprint in terms of its implementation. E.g., Members doing the testing were waiting until the code implementation was complete and so we will have a plan where every member has an active role and not sitting out for long periods of time. In other words, we must have a workflow clearly defined.​

## Sprint 2
- Sprint time: *12/10/21 -14/10/21*
### What Went Well?

Allocated tasks to everyone and prevented bottle necks.​

### What Went Wrong?

We were having some roadblocks with the process of building the application as some of the teams were waiting on other teams to create methods and variables which they require in order to proceed with their task​.

### How can we improve?

Perhaps we can create a detailed UML in order to get the skeleton of the application as well as deciding on what variables we will have along with their names in each class. This may be difficult, so we don’t expect the UML to be spot on with all variables however, it gives the whole team something to work with.​
