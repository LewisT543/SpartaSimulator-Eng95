# Retrospective

## Sprint 1
- Sprint time: *11/10/21 -12/10/21*
### What Went Well?

We were able to communicate efficiently and effectively as a team and stay aware of the changes and steps we were taking. The result of the team work resulted in a successful program which was also tested.

### What Went Wrong?

We were confused on exactly where to allocate everyone at the start of the project as there was no code and so not every group member had a task that they could proceed with.

### How can we improve

For future sprints, we are going to plan how we will start the sprint in terms of its implementation. E.g., Members doing the testing were waiting until the code implementation was complete and so we will have a plan where every member has an active role and not sitting out for long periods of time. This means that there must be a clearly defined workflow made before the sprint starts.
