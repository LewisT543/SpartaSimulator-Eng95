## Introduction <a name ="instroduction"><a/>

In this project we were tasked with creating a simulator for a company like Sparta, this involved the creation of trainees, training centres, and clients all with requirements that need to be met.

## Installation Requirements<a name="installation"><a/>

This project runs with JDK 16, and needs this to operate if downloaded via a cloned repository or downloaded from a zip and installed.

## Instructions<a name="instructions"><a/>

Upon running the system, it will prompt the user in the console with this message:
- *Please enter a number of months for the simulation to run for: *
  The user should then enter a number that isn't 0, and this input is used as the amount of months that the system will simulate the system for.
  Upon submitting a value, the system will output a row of values showing the
- Open training centres
- - This will have a further breakdown showing the amount for each Sparta Centre type.
- Full Training Centres
- - This will have a further breakdown showing the amount for each Sparta Centre type.
- Total Trainees
- - This will have a further breakdown with each student categorised by the current course stream that they're enrolled in
- Waiting List Length
- - This will have a further breakdown with each student categorised by the current course stream that they're enrolled in

  The program should then stop running after showing the results for the set period.(As of first sprint).
